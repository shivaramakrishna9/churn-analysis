# Churn-analysis

An end-to-end churn analysis project using SQL, Power BI, and Python to predict customer churn for a telecom company.

### Introduction to Churn Analysis

In today’s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## STEP 1 – ETL Process in SQL Server

The first step in churn analysis is to load the data from our source file. For this purpose, we will be using Microsoft SQL server because it is a widely used solution across the industry and also because a full-fledged Database System is better at handling recurring data loads and maintaining data integrity compared to an excel file.

**Download SSMS**

In order for us to run our sql queries Microsoft provides us with GUI interface which is known as SQL Server Management Studio. You can download the latest version from the link provided below.

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)

**Creating Database**

After installation, you will land on the following screen. Do remember to copy paste the server name somewhere because we will need this at a later stage. Also enable the checkbox which says “Trust Server Certificate” and then click on Connect.

Once connected, click on the **NEW QUERY** button at the top ribbon and then write the below query. This will create a new Database named `db_Churn`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_Churn
```

**Import csv into SQL server staging table – Import Wizard**

Right-click on the newly created database in the explorer window and then go to:

**Task >> Import >> Flat file >> Browse CSV file**

Remember to add `customerId` as the primary key and allow nulls for all remaining columns. This is done to avoid any errors while data load. Also, make sure to change the datatype where it says `Bit` to `Varchar(50)`. We are doing this because while using the import wizard I faced issues with the `BIT` data type, however `Varchar(50)` works fine.

**Data Exploration – Check Distinct Values**

```sql
SELECT Gender, Count(Gender) as TotalCount,
Count(Gender) * 1.0 / (Select Count(*) from stg_Churn) * 100 as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Gender
```

```sql
SELECT Contract, Count(Contract) as TotalCount,
Count(Contract) * 1.0 / (Select Count(*) from stg_Churn) * 100 as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Contract
```

```sql
SELECT Customer_Status, Count(Customer_Status) as TotalCount, Sum(Total_Revenue) as TotalRev,
Sum(Total_Revenue) / (Select sum(Total_Revenue) from stg_Churn) * 100 as RevPercentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Customer_Status
```

```sql
SELECT State, Count(State) as TotalCount,
Count(State) * 1.0 / (Select Count(*) from stg_Churn) * 100 as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by State
Order by Percentage desc
```

    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn_Reason IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churn_Reason_Null_Count
FROM stg_Churn;```

**Remove null and insert the new data into Prod table**

```sql
SELECT
    Customer_ID,
    Gender,
    Age,
    Married,
    State,
    Number_of_Referrals,

    ISNULL(Churn_Reason , 'Others') AS Churn_Reason
INTO [db_Churn].[dbo].[prod_Churn]
FROM [db_Churn].[dbo].[stg_Churn];
```

**Create View for Power BI**

```sql
Create View vw_ChurnData as
    select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status In ('Churned', 'Stayed')
```

```sql
Create View vw_JoinData as
    select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status = 'Joined'```

---

## STEP 2 – Power BI Transform

**Add a new column in `prod_Churn`**

1.  `Churn Status = if [Customer_Status] = "Churned" then 1 else 0`
2.  Change `Churn Status` data type to numbers.
3.  `Monthly Charge Range = if [Monthly_Charge] < 20 then “< 20” else if [Monthly_Charge] < 50 then “20-50” else if [Monthly_Charge] < 100 then “50-100” else “> 100”`

**Create a New Table Reference for `mapping_AgeGrp`**

1.  Keep only the `Age` column and remove duplicates.
2.  `Age Group = if [Age] < 20 then “< 20” else if [Age] < 36 then “20 – 35” else if [Age] < 51 then “36 – 50” else “> 50”`
3.  `AgeGrpSorting = if [Age Group] = “< 20” then 1 else if [Age Group] = “20 – 35” then 2 else if [Age Group] = “36 – 50” then 3 else 4`
4.  Change the data type of `AgeGrpSorting` to Numbers.

**Create a new table reference for `mapping_TenureGrp`**

1.  Keep only `Tenure_in_Months` and remove duplicates.
2.  `Tenure Group = if [Tenure_in_Months] < 6 then “< 6 Months” else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 12 then “6-12 Months” else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 18 then “12-18 Months” else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 24 then “18-24 Months” else “>= 24 Months”`
3.  `TenureGrpSorting = if [Tenure_in_Months] = “< 6 Months” then 1 else if [Tenure_in_Months] = “6-12 Months” then 2 else if [Tenure_in_Months] = “12-18 Months” then 3 else if [Tenure_in_Months] = “18-24 Months ” then 4 else 5`
4.  Change the data type of `TenureGrpSorting` to Numbers.

**Create a new table reference for `prod_Services`**

1.  Unpivot services columns.
2.  Rename Column – `Attribute` >> `Services` & `Value` >> `Status`

---

## STEP 3 – Power BI Measure

```dax
Total Customers = Count(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])
```

```dax
New Joiners = CALCULATE(COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]), prod_Churn[Customer_Status] = "Joined")
```

```dax
Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn Status])
```

```dax
Churn Rate = [Total Churn] / [Total Customers]
```

## STEP 5 – Predict Customer Churn

For predicting customer churn, we will be using a widely used Machine Learning algorithm called **RANDOM FOREST**.

### What is Random Forest?

A random forest is a machine learning algorithm that consists of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions (in regression tasks) or taking the majority vote (in classification tasks) from all the trees in the forest. This ensemble approach improves the accuracy and robustness of the model by reducing the risk of overfitting compared to using a single decision tree.

### Data Preparation for ML model

Let us first import views in an Excel file.

*   Go to **Data >> Get Data >> SQL Server Database**
*   Enter the Server Name & Database name to connect to SQL Server
*   Import both `vw_ChurnData` & `vw_JoinData`
*   Save the file as `Prediction_Data`

### Create Churn Prediction Model – Random Forest

Now we will work with an application called Jupyter Notebook and we will be coding our ML model in Python. The easiest way to install both of them is to install the ANACONDA Software Package. You can follow the below link to do so:

[https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install)

**Installing Libraries**

Open the Anaconda Command Prompt and run the below code:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
```

**Open Jupyter Notebook, create a new notebook and write the below code:**

**Importing Libraries & Data Load**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import joblib

# Define the path to the Excel file
file_path = r"C:\yourpath\Prediction_Data.xlsx"

# Define the sheet name to read data from
sheet_name = 'vw_ChurnData'

# Read the data from the specified sheet into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)

# Display the first few rows of the fetched data
print(data.head())
```

**Data Preprocessing**

```python
# Drop columns that won't be used for prediction
data = data.drop(['Customer_ID', 'Churn_Category', 'Churn_Reason'], axis=1)

# List of columns to be label encoded
columns_to_encode = [
    'Gender', 'Married', 'State', 'Value_Deal', 'Phone_Service', 'Multiple_Lines',
    'Internet_Service', 'Internet_Type', 'Online_Security', 'Online_Backup',
    'Device_Protection_Plan', 'Premium_Support', 'Streaming_TV', 'Streaming_Movies',
    'Streaming_Music', 'Unlimited_Data', 'Contract', 'Paperless_Billing',
    'Payment_Method'
]

# Encode categorical variables except the target variable
label_encoders = {}
for column in columns_to_encode:
    label_encoders[column] = LabelEncoder()
    data[column] = label_encoders[column].fit_transform(data[column])

# Manually encode the target variable 'Customer_Status'
data['Customer_Status'] = data['Customer_Status'].map({'Stayed': 0, 'Churned': 1})

# Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('Customer_Status', axis=1)
y = data['Customer_Status']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

**Train Random Forest Model**

```python
# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Evaluate Model**

```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Feature Selection using Feature Importance
importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]

# Plot the feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
sns.barplot(x=importances[indices], y=X.columns[indices])
plt.title('Feature Importances')
plt.xlabel('Relative Importance')
plt.ylabel('Feature Names')
plt.show()
```

**Use Model for Prediction on New Data**

```python
# Define the path to the Joiner Data Excel file
file_path = r"C:\yourpath\Prediction_Data.xlsx"

# Define the sheet name to read data from
sheet_name = 'vw_JoinData'

# Read the data from the specified sheet into a pandas DataFrame
new_data = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)

# Display the first few rows of the fetched data
print(new_data.head())

# Retain the original DataFrame to preserve unencoded columns
original_data = new_data.copy()

# Retain the Customer_ID column
customer_ids = new_data['Customer_ID']

# Drop columns that won't be used for prediction in the encoded DataFrame
new_data = new_data.drop(['Customer_ID', 'Customer_Status', 'Churn_Category', 'Churn_Reason'], axis=1)

# Encode categorical variables using the saved label encoders
for column in new_data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:
    new_data[column] = label_encoders[column].transform(new_data[column])

# Make predictions
new_predictions = rf_model.predict(new_data)

# Add predictions to the original DataFrame
original_data['Customer_Status_Predicted'] = new_predictions

# Filter the DataFrame to include only records predicted as "Churned"
original_data = original_data[original_data['Customer_Status_Predicted'] == 1]

# Save the results
original_data.to_csv(r"C:\yourpath\Predictions.csv", index=False)
```

---

## STEP 6 – Power BI Visualization of Predicted Data

Import CSV Data or Load Predicted data in SQL server & connect to the server.

**Create Measures**

```dax
Count Predicted Churner = COUNT(Predictions[Customer_ID]) + 0```

```dax
Title Predicted Churners = “COUNT OF PREDICTED CHURNERS : ” & COUNT(Predictions[Customer_ID])
```

### Churn Prediction Page (Using New Predicted Data)

1.  **Right Side Grid**
    *   Customer ID
    *   Monthly Charge
    *   Total Revenue
    *   Total Refunds
    *   Number of Referrals
2.  **Demographic**
    *   Gender – Churn Count
    *   Age Group – Churn Count
    *   Marital Status – Churn Count
3.  **Account Info**
    *   Payment Method – Churn Count
    *   Contract – Churn Count
    *   Tenure Group – Churn Count
4.  **Geographic**
    *   State – Churn Count

That’s it, now you have a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with an Executive Summary to analyze historical data and also a Churn Prediction page to predict future churners. Hope I was able to provide value with this content. Keep following for more content. Cheers
